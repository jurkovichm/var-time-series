### Introduction

- Motivated by the goal of predicting a time series via a correlated partner time series, we will investigate Vector Autoregressive models (AKA VAR(p) models). 

- Why VAR models exist, what they're better at than AR models. In predictions they don't just include a variable at time t, but take all previous observations into account.
